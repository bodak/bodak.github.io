I own a Yamaha ISX-800. It is a gorgeous speaker system for your living room. Released in 2011, it had a wide range of connectivity features relevant at the time. It can connect :
- iPod / iPhone connectivity through 30-pin stand on top
- CD player (MP3)
- USB (MP3)
- FM/AM digital radio
- AUX input

Recently, I started using the system less and less as I got accustomed to newer technologies. Picking up the iPhone 5S/SE meant I could no longer use the docking station due to the lack of newer Lightning port. I also missed the convenient wireless technologies (Airplay, Bluetooth) available in other products. All in all, the speaker was left to dust as an art-piece while time passed by.

Over the past weekend I decided to change this by looking at adding the features I was missing to the speaker. I felt adding the below would make me want to use speaker again:
Lightning port dock by replacing the old 30 pin
Bluetooth wireless connectivity

## 1. Adding the Lightning port

Deep-diving into the schematics of Lightning Connectors made me realized its complexity. It was simpler to hack a Lightning to 30-pin Adapter ($29) on top of the existing casing. The top of the plastic had to be widened for the adapter to fit, but it the end it worked out well. Some glue and 2 longer screws holds everything in place. My iPhone SE is recognized without any issues and charges/plays nicely.

## 2. Adding Bluetooth connectivity
Bluetooth connectivity turned out to be more complicated. After browsing the web, I opted to order an XS3868 bluetooth audio board based on the OVC3860 chipset. The cheap module offered a good range of features I wanted to integrate (stereo audio, bluetooth V2.0). Audio quality turned out to be decent.

External RESET button & cable to AUX INFor integration, I wanted to keep the impact on current systems to a minimum. While the board is placed within the speaker it connects externally through the AUX input jack. I can unplug the bluetooth module at any time from the outside.

The bluetooth module found it place on the top right under the main circuit boards. 12V power is routed from the main power adapter of the speaker system seen at the bottom of the case.

## Final thoughts
I am very pleased with the outcome. My phone finds itself charging on the stand frequently while playing music while connecting any phone, Mac or PC through bluetooth is now a breeze. I think we are set for another few years.
