I have had a few requests in the past to share my development setup. This first part covers UI applications I find helpful for development workflows. In the second part, I will cover tools I use to manage information and creative work.

Everything listed is installed through CLI with `brew`.

## Development

```
cask "alacritty"
cask "visual-studio-code"
cask "lens"
cask "beekeeper-studio"
cask "postman"
cask "raycast"
cask "amethyst"
cask "spaceman"
cask "firefox"
cask "forklift"
```

### Terminal --- `cask "alacritty"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/alacritty-ls.png)

[Link](https://alacritty.org/)

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator and has been my default terminal for the past few years. I prefer it for being feature-minimal, faster and cross-platform over alternatives I tried in the past (`iTerm2`, `kitty`).

I am also planning to write a short post on my terminal setup and will link back once that is published.

### Code editor ---  `cask "visual-studio-code"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/vscode.png)

[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I set up VSCode exactly how I would like an IDE to function when it first came out 7 years ago. I haven't looked at anything else since. It works across all platforms and is frequently updated and open-source (although with telemetry and integration into Microsoft).

Extensions (less is more):
- Python `ms-python`
- Gitlens `eamodio`
- Ruff `charliermarsh.ruff`
- Rust Analyser `rust-lang`

Theme:
- Fluorescence `bodak`

Lately, I have been considering switching to the VSCodium fork.

### Kubernetes client --- `cask "lens"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/lens.png)

[Link](https://k8slens.dev/)

I use Lens frequently to visually check on Kubernetes clusters (at home or work). It provides a nice UI for most common tasks, e.g. quickly launching a terminal inside or seeing logs of a pod.

I still use CLI `kubectl` for applying and deleting K8 objects.

Lately, I have been considering switching to the OpenLens fork.

### Database Management --- `cask "beekeeper-studio"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/beekeeper-studio.png)

[Link](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/)

I rarely work with traditional databases anymore, but for any quick query or debugging, I use Beekeeper Studio. It supports almost all connection types I would need and is open-source.

### API testing --- `cask "postman"`

Postman![](/assets/images/macapps/postman.png)

[Link](https://www.postman.com/)

Postman is a free app to test APIs. I usually use Postman if I have to quickly evaluate a new cloud API or when I am developing my API endpoints. It is usually to sanity check for ensuring I am familiar with the API schema before coding it up in `requests`.

## Workflow
### Application launcher --- `cask "raycast"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/raycast.png)

[Link](https://www.raycast.com/)

I used to use the first version of Alfred in 2008 but never purchased subsequent versions. I moved to plain Spotlight and it worked very well.

I am currently trialling Raycast. It has some very convenient actions, but I am concerned about it being a closed-source and team subscription-based business model. I will most likely convert their most useful actions to Apple Automator and use Spotlight again.

### Web tools --- `cask "ferdium"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/ferdium.png)

[Link](https://ferdium.org/)

I prefer to keep my browser tab count minimal, so any web service finds itself quickly migrating to Ferdium. I also have workspaces set up so social, private and work web services are separated.

### Window manager --- `cask "amethyst"`

![](/assets/images/macapps/amethyst.png)

[Link](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/)

Amethyst just "works". It's an open-source window manager that brings the spirit of `xmonad` and `i3` to Mac. I have come to prefer it over `Moom` / `Spectacles`. It also has no requirement for System Integrity Protection to be disabled (`yabai`).

I am using a two window layout setup (i) single window full-screen (ii) split window full-screen. I then use built-in spaces to separate work environments.

### Space manager --- `cask "spaceman"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/spaceman.png)

[Link](https://www.jaysce.dev/projects/spaceman)

SpaceMan is a helpful menubar app to see what space you are in and how many spaces you have open. Supports multiple displays!

### Browser --- `cask "firefox"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/firefox.png)

[Link](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

At this point, I have probably used all browsers available on a Mac at one point. Chrome became too resource-hungry, Safari dropped support for most of my extensions, Brave is a commercial product. In the end, I have been using Firefox for the past few years. It's reliable, open-source and supports lots of extensions.

One of my favourite features of Firefox is *Firefox Multi-Account Containers*. I like "containerizing" my browser whether that is for personal / work separation or just general security.

###  File manager --- `cask "forklift"`
![](/assets/images/macapps/forklift.png)

[Link](https://binarynights.com/)

This is the only paid app on this list. Forklift 3 supports dual pane file management and most transfer protocols I need daily (SFTP, FTP, S3). This makes it convenient to move files around both locally and remote.

I frequently think I should just do this in the terminal (nnn, ranger), but I keep coming back to the convenience of Forklift's GUI.
